# Munchkin
Munchkin is a mac application written in swift by Henry Moyerman

This app was the main focus of Henry Moyerman's Master's Project at 
Washington University in St. Louis

Munchkin is a card game that was written as a parody of role playing games

This version is simplified slightly, but still very true to the original

The app is designed for one human player against three AI players
